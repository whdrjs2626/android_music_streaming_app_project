hey good morning
got a warning
from a friend
let’s pretend  
she didn’t mention your name
she’s just waiting
detonating
and you’ve showed
you’ll explode
but i go up in flames

and you say
it’s ok
but i wonder if you mean it
when every song that you sing is the blues
fill me up
to the top
don’t you stop
with gasoline and
you’re putting a match to my fuse
yeah light it i’m comin apart
i got a molotov heart

got me drinkin
got me thinkin
high octane
tell me plain
do you want me to go
you’re bartending
guess it’s ending
mix it up
fill my cup
you know it’s gonna blow

hear the drummin
hear them comin
i can tell the rebellion’s about to start
should’ve known
overthrown
get your gun
i won’t run
it’s a shot to the heart
