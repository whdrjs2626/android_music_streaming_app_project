It's half past ten
You called again
Running lines in my head
Avoiding where and when
Something tells me slip those shoes on your feet
Turn out the lights
That's the last ring before they leave you behind
Take one last look
Make your way down the drive
Don't know where you're going
Buckle-up for the ride
All is right after midnight
It's like the dark is the light
All is right after midnight
After hours begin
You search the crowd for a hand
In the outside hues
Hoping for a new point of view
Lately I've been fighting, melancholy communication
Lately I've been feeling, burn out with reminiscing
Lately I've been watching, days roll with no prediction
Maybe I'm just missing, good times and bad decisions
It's so obvious now
I tried to figure it out
Steady is not coming around
Oh no
All is right after midnight
It's like the dark is the light
All is right after midnight
All is right after midnight
It's like the dark is the light
All is right after midnight

It's half past ten
You called again
Running lines in my head
Avoiding where and when
Something tells me slip those shoes on your feet
Turn out the lights
That's the last ring before they leave you behind
Take one last look
Make your way down the drive
Don't know where you're going
Buckle-up for the ride
All is right after midnight
It's like the dark is the light
All is right after midnight
After hours begin
You search the crowd for a hand
In the outside hues
Hoping for a new point of view
Lately I've been fighting, melancholy communication
Lately I've been feeling, burn out with reminiscing
Lately I've been watching, days roll with no prediction
Maybe I'm just missing, good times and bad decisions
It's so obvious now
I tried to figure it out
Steady is not coming around
Oh no
All is right after midnight
It's like the dark is the light
All is right after midnight
All is right after midnight
It's like the dark is the light
All is right after midnight
