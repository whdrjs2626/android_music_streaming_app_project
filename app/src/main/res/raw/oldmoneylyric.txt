This is your destination
Please check your hidden fees
We got no reservations
But we go where we please
Shake it off
I’m taking off

Hide your information
Watch what you believe
New indoctrination
We write everything you read
We’re showing off
And you just blow it off

Switch that conversation
We’re watching what you speak
You got obligations
We got everything we need
Lets walk the dog
Lets watch him pay it off
I can’t make enough and
You don’t get a break
You can’t pay the rent
And i’m in outer space
I’m a god
You should probably get a job

Yeah
That’s that old money
That’s that big estate
And we’ll just take your soul money
That you ain’t even worth weight in gold money
That you will never really have control money
that you will do exactly as your told money

So shake it off
Hey, this is paying off
I think i’ll take it all

Switch your occupation
I need new machines
I need altercations
I need room to breathe
Now shoot to kill
Make em foot to bill

Scrap that education
Teach them with the feed
A whole new generation
They can shoot
But they can’t read
Lord help us all
We’re dumb and growing tall
You get no explanations
We supply the screens
Build up confrontations
Than split them up in teams
And piss em off
Go wave the flag
And kiss the cross

This is preservation
Its all been engineered
He made some accusations
But than he disappeared
Who would’ve thought?
Somebody just wiped him off

Yeah
That’s that old money
That’s that big estate
And we’ll just take your soul money
That you ain’t even worth weight in gold money
That you will never really have control money
that you will do exactly as your told money

Old Money

Soul Money
