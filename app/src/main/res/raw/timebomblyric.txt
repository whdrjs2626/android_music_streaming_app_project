I got a feeling that I can't quite shake
All she wanna do is take take take
She's coming through like an earthquake quake
Destroying everything that's in her way
She moves fast but she's talking slow
The clock ticks and she's ready to go
Tick tick tick tick

She's ready to blow
She's like a timebomb but got the time wrong
She keeps on coming around she keeps on coming
She's ready to go she's ready to go

Timers set and it won't be long
A short fuse you just can't disarm
Ten thousand ways to defuse that bomb
But it only takes one try to get it wrong

She's ready to blow
She's like a timebomb but got the time wrong
She keeps on coming around she keeps on coming
She's ready to go she's ready to go

There's a time to consider changing
There's a time but she's too inpatient
There's a time for deescalating
There's a time but she's always wasting
Now there's no time no time at all
