[Verse 1]
First, tell me how you feel, don't say you fine
We back and forth, every time, outta line
But I'm lying if I say we don't got the time
It ain't my fault, ain't my fault
It’s a blind spot or a state of mind?
Can’t even tell the difference if you real or when you lying
I be doubting all the benefits, but fuck it I don’t mind
I’ll handle the shit like my overall 99
Inadvertently you be hurting me no cap
The curtain close, the lights dim, it's a steel trap
You can’t tell me you don’t do that shit
You can’t be on the gram “new phone, who dis?” huh
I know to you it’s probably something light
And then again that’s probably why we fight, but I ignore it
Separating all the lies just to see if we can vibe
I’ll be waiting outside saying baby we’ll be fine

There’s not much more I'ma say
You're so busy through the day
I know that you wanna stay
You just wanna work and play

There’s not much more I'ma say
You're so busy through the day
I know that you wanna stay
You just wanna work and play

[Verse 2]
Storytelling hereditary, I fill the void
I make space at my own pace, I don't wait
I’m on point, I’m all for it, It’s nothing new
Saying it’s a hobby nigga, this is all I fucking do
Hate when niggas say they understand, you don’t understand
How I got a fuckin' degree inside of my father's crib
When’s ya boy gonna do it? When’s he gonna win
When’s he gonna have his girl not question where he live?
The path I take, yeah, I know I got a choice
My mom off it, off topic, it’s all love
My girl with it, she see the vision, it’s all love
Funny how love can be a love that’s not enough
Funny how a buzz can suddenly make you give a fuck
Funny how I got to where I am when I did enough
Funny how you don't understand til want something
But you ain't gonna say that

But you ain't gonna say that

Separating all the lies just to see if we can vibe
I’ll be waiting outside saying baby we’ll be fine

[Chrous]
There’s not much more I'ma say
You're so busy through the day
I know that you wanna stay
You just wanna work and play

There’s not much more I'ma say
You're so busy through the day
I know that you wanna stay
You just wanna work and play
